# Internal Knowledge Base Article
<h2><a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/html/Agent guide to processing loan extensions [Gram Sample].html" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent guide to processing loan extensions</a></h2>

<h2>Project overview</h2>
<p>I wrote this internal Knowledge Base sample article for library circulation staff based on publicly-available Los Angeles Public Library policies. This sample demonstrates the type of agent-facing documentation I create at Google to help support teams speak to customers.</p>

<h2>Content strategy</h2>
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> I organized this article to focus on agent tasks, beginning with everyday tasks (renewals) and progressing to edge cases (lost cards, damaged items) so that agents could quickly find the sections they need.</p>
<p><strong>Scripted responses:</strong> The canned responses and scripted answers give starting points for agents to talk to customers, similar to the canned responses and FAQs I develop for Google support teams.</p>

<h2>Writing and design approach</h2>
<p><strong>Visual hierarchy for reference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HTML “code” tags for UI elements</li>
<li>Collapsible sections to reduce cognitive load</li>
<li>Color-coded reference boxes to emphasize important information</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Style standards (based on Google’s style guide):</strong></p>
 <ul>
<li>Tone: friendly, empathetic, conversational (contraction use is OK)</li>
<li>Clarity: 7th grade reading level, active voice, front-loaded sentences</li>
<li>Formatting: Sentence case for titles, title case for UI; breadcrumb navigation</li>
<li>Canned responses emphasize empathy for the user. For example: “I hope you’re doing well,” and “Thank you for your patience.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Task-based workflows for common circulation scenarios</li>
  <li>Eligibility reference table for quick policy checks</li> 
<li>Canned email and chat responses with bracketed placeholders for personalization</li>
<li>Includes a metrics reporting section so agents understand when to escalate system issues</li>
</ul>
