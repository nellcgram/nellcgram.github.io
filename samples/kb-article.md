# Internal Knowledge Base Article
<h2><a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/html/Agent guide to processing loan extensions [Gram Sample].html" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent guide to processing loan extensions</a></h2>

<h3><b>About:</b></h3>
<p>I wrote this internal Knowledge Base sample article for library circulation agents based on publicly-available Los Angeles Public Library policies. It is similar to the work I do for Google in that itâ€™s agent-facing, structured documentation to help support teams handle patron requests.</p>

<h3><b>Key elements included:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Step-by-step workflows that demonstrate agent tasks, from patron verification to case logging</li>
<li>Canned response emails that agents can copy and customize for common situations</li>
<li>Color-coded reference and callout boxes (including policy notes, best practices, critical alerts, escalation guidelines) so agents can quickly find information</li>
<li>A "special scenarios" section covering items on hold, maximum renewals, and overdue items</li>
<li>A "Common Patron Questions" section with scripted responses for agents</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>My approach:</b></h3>
<p>I organized this article to focus on agent tasks while also adding reference boxes and an eligibility table so agents can quickly scan for important information. I started with every-day tasks and moved to more unusual scenarios so agents could find only the section they needed. The canned responses and scripted answers are meant to give agents a starting point for talking to customers, and are similar to the canned responses and FAQs I work on for Google.</p>
