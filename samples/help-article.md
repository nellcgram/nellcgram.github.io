# Help Center Article
<h2><a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/html/hc_scribbler_gram_sample.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to use Story Board view in Scribbler</a></h2>

<h3><b>About:</b></h3>
<p>I wrote this sample about a fictional writing app called Scribbler in the style of the structured Help Center documentation I write for Google Play. I explored writing about the app Scrivener, but decided to fictionalize some steps since Scrivener is so complex. I describe a similar user interface to Scrivener with some of the same names.</p>

<h3><b>Key elements included:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>I used a rough approximation of Google's style guide: sentence case for titles, about a 7th grade reading level, informal voice and breadcrumbing navigation with the "and then" or < icon.</li>
<li>I created the article with HTML and added CSS over time, purposefully echoing my GitHub website "Just the Docs" theme.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>My approach:</b></h3>
<p>I organized this article to help users quickly find what they need. ??</p>

<h3><b>Information architecture:</b></h3> 
<p><a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/pdf/hc_scribbler.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This sample includes IA annotations</a> showing a content model used for single-source publishing in a Content Management System. Content is structured into reusable blocks (instructions, definitions, tips, etc.) that can be published across multiple platforms and localized into other languages. I chose a Help Center "How to / About" content model, a common model I would use when drafting for Google.</p>
