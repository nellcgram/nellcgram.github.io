# About
Hi, I'm Nell! I'm a Senior Technical Writer with 6+ years of experience creating documentation for consumer products at Google (contracted through Accenture). I specialize in Help Center articles, troubleshooting guides, and internal knowledge base content for support teams.

Currently, I manage a global team of 6 writers, where I create documentation for Google Play (2+ billion users) across 80+ languages. My work includes public-facing Help Center articles, internal knowledge base guides for customer service agents, and training AI systems to generate high-quality documentation.

This portfolio includes:
- Customer-facing help documentation
- Troubleshooting guides
- Internal knowledge base articles for support agents
- Structured authoring and information architecture

<h3>Help Center Article Sample: <a href="https://github.com/nellcgram/nellcgram.github.io/blob/main/Help%20Center%20article%20%5BGram%20Sample%5D.pdf" target="_blank">App Store Personalization and Data Privacy</a></h3>

<h4><b>What this demonstrates:</b></h4>
<p>I wrote this sample about a fictional app store called Chronicle in the style of the structured Help Center documentation I write for Google Play. It demonstrates how I build user-friendly articles that balance instructions with explanatory text, similar to the Google Play Help Center articles I create in my job.</p>

<h4><b>Key elements included:</b></h4>
<ul><li>Structured content with clear block types (instructions, definitions, tips) for readability</li>
<li>Multi-platform support with separate instructions for computer and phone experiences (computer text included only).</li>
<li>User-centered explanations - "What will change" section helps users understand their choices.</li></ul>

<h4><b>My approach:</b></h4>
I organized this article to help users quickly find what they need. Instructions are separated from explanatory content, and the article moves from simple (turn off all personalization) to advanced (manage specific data types). 

<h4><b>Information architecture:</b></h4>  This sample includes IA annotations showing the content model used for single-source publishing in content management systems. Content is structured into reusable blocks that can be published across multiple platforms and localized into 80+ languages - the same approach I use for Google Play documentation

<h3>Knowledge Base article</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Release notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>About:</b>  For this sample, I created release notes from the user’s perspective in user-friendly language. I wanted to mirror the type of release notes I write and edit for Google Play. An example of this type: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/13585779</li>
