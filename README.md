# About
Hi, I'm Nell! Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm a technical writer with a background as an editor and researcher and experience managing small teams. 

<b>Geography:</b> I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but I lived in Ohio for college and Illinois for graduate school. Today I spend time in Los Angeles and New York City (I have family in both places) and I'm open to relocating for work.
