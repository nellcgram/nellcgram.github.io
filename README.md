# About
Hi, I'm Nell! I'm a Senior Technical Writer with 6+ years of experience and a background as an editor and researcher. Currently I work for Accenture supporting Google, where I manage a small team of writers. I write, edit and publish documentation for the public-facing [Google Play Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=3364260). I also work on other documentation types including internal, agent-facing Knowledge Base troubleshooting guides, canned responses, and agent announcements. 

<b>Geography</b>

<h3>Release notes</h3>
- About:  For this sample, I created release notes from the user’s perspective in user-friendly language. I wanted to mirror the type of release notes I write and edit for Google Play. An example of this type: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/13585779
