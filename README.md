# About
<p>Hi, I'm Nell! I'm a Senior Technical Writer with 6+ years of experience creating documentation for consumer products at Google (contracted through Accenture). Currently I supervise a global team of 5 writers and create documentation for Google Play (2+ billion users) across 80+ languages. My work includes public-facing help documentation, internal knowledge base guides, and agent-facing content (announcements and canned responses). Most recently I have been training AI systems to generate documentation that aligns with Google's style guide.</p>

<p>This portfolio includes samples of a Help Center article, release notes, and internal KB documentation similar to the work I create at Google.</p>

<H2>Writing Samples</H2>

<h3>Help Center Article Sample: <a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/Help%20Center%20article%20%5BGram%20Sample%5D.pdf" target="_blank">App Store Personalization and Data Privacy</a></h3>

<h4><b>About:</b></h4>
<p>I wrote this sample about a fictional app store called Chronicle in the style of the structured Help Center documentation I write for Google Play. It demonstrates how I build user-friendly articles that balance instructions with explanatory text, similar to the Google Play Help Center articles I create in my job.</p>

<h4><b>Key elements included:</b></h4>
<ul><li>Structured content with clear block types (instructions, definitions, tips) for readability</li>
<li>Multi-platform support with separate instructions for computer and phone experiences (computer text included only).</li>
<li>User-centered explanations - "What will change" section helps users understand their choices.</li></ul>

<h4><b>My approach:</b></h4>
I organized this article to help users quickly find what they need. Instructions are separated from explanatory content, and the article moves from simple (turn off all personalization) to advanced (manage specific data types). 

<h4><b>Information architecture:</b></h4>  This sample includes IA annotations showing the content model used for single-source publishing in content management systems. Content is structured into reusable blocks that can be published across multiple platforms and localized into 80+ languages - the same approach I use for Google Play documentation

<h3>Knowledge Base Article Sample: <a href="??" target="_blank">Knowledge Base</a></li></h3>

<h3>Release notes: <a href="https://nellcgram.github.io/Release%20Notes%20eReader%20App%20%5BGram%20Sample%5D.pdf" target="_blank">eReader App Release Notes</a></h3>

<h4><b>About:</b></h4>
I wrote these sample release notes for a fictional eReader app in the style of the release notes I write for Google Play. A real-world example of this type of work: <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/13585779" target="_blank">Release notes for Google Play Games on PC</a>

<h4><b>Key elements included:</b></h4>
<ul><li>Not just what’s new, but how it benefits the user (for example, "Adds a streak tracker that shows how many days you've read in a row," instead of "Implements streak tracking functionality")</li>
<li>Action-oriented language to help users understand new app functions</li>
<li>A mix of major features and performance improvements to set user expectations</li></ul>
</ul>

<h4><b>My approach:</b></h4>
I wrote user-focused release notes instead of technical changelogs so that users would understand why new features are valuable. The idea is to reduce support inquiries and increase the chance users will adopt new features.
