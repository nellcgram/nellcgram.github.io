# About me

<p>Hi, I'm Nell. I'm a Senior Technical Writer for Accenture on contract with Google. I write documentation for Google Play's 2+ billion users and manage a team of 5 writers globally.</p>

<p>Specifically, I write and edit public-facing help documentation, internal knowledge base guides, and agent-facing content like announcements and canned responses. This site includes sample documentation I've written.</p>

<H2>The details</H2>
<p>My job also has several aspects beyond writing:</p>

<p><strong>I manage projects and people.</strong> As a writer, I manage projects from initial documentation design design through post-publish Quality Assurance. I meet with stakeholders as needed through the process to clarify project requirements and address issues. As a manager, I assign projects to my team of writers and guide them through their project life cycles.</p>

<p><strong>I edit in collaboration with cross-functional teams.</strong> I work with content strategists, product managers, legal teams, and usability experts to edit both public-facing and agent-facing documentation. I love balancing each team's needs while still finding the right language to describe what an application actually does.</p>

<p><strong>I design content.</strong> I build the systems that make content possible. This might mean creating a style guide for the team, or writing a template for project requirements. My Information Science degree reflects my love of making information scannable and searchable; I am your go-to person to fix an article’s structure with the right information architecture or add metadata before publication. I consider how content will hold up over time and how to design it to stay useful.

<p><strong>I'm passionate about usability and accessibility.</strong> I test documentation and procedures by actually using them. Some days I walk through SOPs to find what's confusing. Others, I collaborate with engineers to improve a new project management software before rollout. I have professional experience in making content accessible for users with disabilities, which is often useful in my current work.</p>

<p><strong>I'm an AI trainer and editor.</strong> I train AI systems to generate documentation on specific topics through prompt engineering, then edit the output to align with our style guide and standards. In time, I can see that my work will focus more on editing and content strategy as generative AI will write all content first drafts, but we're not quite there yet in my role.</p>

<p>I hope this description gives you a fuller picture of my work than a resume can capture, though you can find the obligatory resume below.</p>

<H2>Professional history</H2>
<p>I grew up in Los Angeles, went to college in Ohio, and majored in English. Though I went to grad school to become a corporate researcher, writing has always been my favorite part of work; eventually I became (surprise) a professional writer. But "no knowledge is wasted," and I still organize information as a technical writer.</p>
