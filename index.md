# Nell C. Gram

<p>Hi, I'm Nell. I'm a Senior Technical Writer at Accenture supporting Google, where I create documentation for consumer products and supervise a global team of 5 writers. I support Google Play, which serves over 2 billion users.</p>

<p>That's the short version. My job has several aspects that the title doesn't explain. Yes, I write and edit public-facing help documentation, internal knowledge base guides, and agent-facing content like announcements and canned responses. I'm also...
 
<p><strong>A project and people manager.</strong> As a writer, I guide projects from initial documentation design design through post-publish Quality Assurance. I meet with stakeholders as needed through the process to clarify project requirements and address issues. As a manager, I assign projects to my team of writers and guide them through their project life cycles.</p>

<p><strong>A collaborator with cross-functional teams.</strong> Beyond managing projects, I edit alongside content strategists, product managers, legal teams, and usability experts. I love balancing each team's needs while still finding the right language to describe what an application actually does.</p>

<p><strong>A content designer.</strong> I build the systems that make content possible. This might mean creating a style guide for the team, or writing a template for project requirements. My Information Science degree reflects my love of making information scannable and searchable; I am your go-to person to fix an article’s structure with the right information architecture or add metadata before publication. I consider how content will hold up over time and how to design it to stay useful.

<p><strong>Passionate about usability.</strong> I test documentation by actually using it, which includes walking through SOPs to find what's confusing, or collaborating with engineers to improve our new project management software before rollout.</p>

<p><strong>An AI trainer and editor.</strong> I train AI systems to generate documentation on specific topics through prompt engineering, then edit the output to align with our style guide and standards. In time, I can see that my work will become more about editing and content strategy than writing as first drafts will be written by generative AI.</p>
